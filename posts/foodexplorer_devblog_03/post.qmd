# Resuming Quarto kernel troubleshootings

After yesterday's failure, I set up a virtual environment inside my blog project folder, as recommended in the Debian documentation for Python library modules. This is the code I run:

```
mkdir -p ./.venvs

# Creating a folder inside a virtual environment
python3 -m venv ./.venvs/jupyter 

# Installing the Python package there
./.venvs/jupyter/bin/python -m pip install jupyter

quarto check jupyter

# Output:
Quarto 1.7.32
[✓] Checking Python 3 installation....OK
      Version: 3.12.3
      Path: /home/carlos/Documents/R/blog/.venv/bin/python
      Jupyter: (None)

      Jupyter is not available in this Python installation.
      Install with python3 -m pip install jupyter
```

Maybe I misspecified the venv folder? `.venvs` instead of `.venv`. Now I have a lot of half-empty venv-like folders all over the place. 

I'll try again tomorrow following this [tutorial on how to set up Quarto virtual environments](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/virtual-environments.html).
